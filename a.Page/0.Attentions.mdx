# Attentions

Precautions in writing JSONã€‚

## Naming

- For some historical reasons, when specifying a component with `type : [component]`, the first letter of the component should be lowercase, such as `InputNumber`, which is described as `"type" : "inputNumber"`. This issue will be resolved in the next major release.

- The object key and label in columns need to be consistent. This is also a historical reason and will be fixed in the next major version.

## Error

Since the project was born mainly to improve the internal productivity of the team, there is no fine-grained error throwing under the conventional writing description, so developers may encounter the interface is empty in the process of writing the JSON debugging interface. In this case, there are usually the following reasons:

- The JSON description is not standardized, such as wrong component name, wrong props key value, etc.

- Data parsing error, the parsed data format does not match the data format required by the component.

## Solution

### About the error

We will add fault tolerance mechanisms to components in the subsequent iteration process to provide developers with a better debugging experience. At the same time, in the next major version, this part will be refactored, and after the refactoring, more will be added at the architectural level fault tolerance mechanism.
