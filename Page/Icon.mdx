# Icon

Semantic vector graphics. To use icon components, you need to know some basic usage:

## Scenes

- Instead of text, express content visually

- As a symbol, giving hints to users

## Example

<Notice type='warning'>
	Icon components can be used in many places, such as table custom options, and form custom
	actions, etc. Note that the source of the icon used will be different for different naming
	methods.
</Notice>

```tsx
<Icon name='icon-download' size={18}></Icon>
```

## Props

```ts
/** Icon component, supports the following two icon libraries:
 * feather icon https://feathericons.com/
 * material design icon https://fonts.google.com/icons
 */

interface IProps {
	/** Chart style class */
	className?: string
	/** Icon name, starts with `icon` for feather icon and ends with `outline/filled` for material design icon */
	name: string
	/** Icon size in px */
	size?: number
	/** Icon color, applicable to all font colors */
	color?: string
	/** Click event */
	onClick?: () => void
}
```
