# Cascader

Cascading selection boxes.

## scenes to be used

- Need to select from a set of related data sets, such as provinces, municipalities, company levels, classification of things, etc.

- When selecting from a larger data set, separate with multi-level classification for easy selection.

- Compared with the Select component, the selection can be completed in the same floating layer, which has a better experience.

## Example

```json
{
	"Cascader": {
		"bind": "Cascader_value",
		"edit": {
			"type": "Cascader",
			"props": {
				"showSearch": true,
				"placeholder": "Please select the manufacturer",
				"xProps": {
					"remote": {
						"api": "/api/cascader/search",
						"query": {
							"select": ["id", "name"]
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Props

```ts
interface IProps extends Remote.IProps, CascaderProps<any> {}
```
