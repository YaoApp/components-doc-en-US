# Select

Dropdown selector, an enhanced component for html5 select.

## Scenes to be used

- Pop up a drop-down menu for the user to choose an action to use instead of a native selector, or when a more elegant multi-selector is needed.

- When there are few options (less than 5 items), it is recommended to tile the options directly, using Radio is a better choice.

## Example

```json
{
	"Select": {
		"bind": "Select_value",
		"edit": {
			"type": "Select",
			"props": {
				"tree": true,
				"searchable": true,
				"xProps": {
					"remote": {
						"api": "/api/kind/tree",
						"search": {
							"select": ["id", "name"],
							"keyword": "where_name_like"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Props

```ts
interface IProps extends Remote.IProps, SelectProps {}
```
